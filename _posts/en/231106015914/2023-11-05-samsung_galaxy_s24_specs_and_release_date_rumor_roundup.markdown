As the release date of the Samsung Galaxy S24 approaches, rumors are emerging about rendered images and expected specifications.  

In summary, the Galaxy S 24 series is scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2024, has a titanium exterior, downgraded camera performance, and is expected to be equipped with Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon AP depending on the model.  

Now let’s take a closer look at the related rumors.  
## When To Release - December 2023 or January 2024

Samsung Electronics plans to release new smartphones in December 2023 or January 2024, aiming to recover from semiconductor underperformance. In December, they will launch the Galaxy S23 FE, a mid-range phone, followed by the flagship Galaxy S24, which will have AI capabilities and will be unveiled in January in San Francisco, earlier than the usual February release.  

This shift is seen as a response to challenges in the smartphone market and competition from Apple's iPhone 15 series. Samsung is relying on its mobile experience (MX) division to counterbalance declining semiconductor profits, as they posted significant losses in the semiconductor (DS) division during Q3 2022.  
## Appearance and Design - Titanium

According to recent predictions by IT expert Lebegnerz, the entire Galaxy S24 series is expected to feature titanium material frames, enhancing the overall design aesthetics. This move is seen as part of a broader strategy, similar to Apple's introduction of titanium frames in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models.  

Furthermore, the exterior design is anticipated to undergo a transformation, shifting from a rounded form to a more angular design, adding a touch of luxury. There are also speculations that the distinctive edge display of the Ultra model will be completely replaced with a flat display.  
## Camera - Downgrade But,

Next year's release of the Galaxy S24 Ultra has created concerns among users as it's rumored to downgrade from a 10x optical zoom to 5x optical zoom.  

However, some experts, like SamMobile, argue that it's actually a positive move due to overall video recording improvements.  

The S24 Ultra is said to feature a 200MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide, 3x optical zoom 10MP telephoto, and 5x optical zoom 50MP telephoto cameras. The 5x zoom is seen as an upgrade with a wider aperture and larger pixels, allowing for high-quality zoom photos. Notably, the 5x zoom camera can capture smooth 4K 60fps videos across all angles.  
## AP - Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 and Exynos

It is certain that the Samsung Galaxy S24 will be equipped with Qualcomm Stepdragon because in the fourth quarter of 2023 earnings announcement, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said that the Galaxy S24 will be released soon and that Qualcomm will take the majority share in terms of onboard components.  

Samsung's wireless division had been using both Snapdragon and Exynos processors in their smartphones up to the Galaxy S22. However, due to heating issues with Exynos, the Galaxy S23 model, released earlier this year, exclusively featured Qualcomm. The upcoming S24 and S24 Plus models, set to be released early next year, will employ both Snapdragon and Exynos processors based on regional considerations. The highest-priced Ultra model is confirmed to exclusively use Snapdragon.  

the Geekbench score of the Snapdragon Gen 3-based Galaxy S24 Ultra was also discovered. According to the database, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is powered by `the Snapdragon 8 3rd generation` chipset codenamed `Pineapple` and is confirmed to be equipped with 8GB of RAM and the Android 14 operating system.  

In the single and multi-core tests, it scored `2234` and `6807` points, respectively, with the multi-core score slightly increasing compared to the model tested last July.

On October 12, 2023, benchmark results for the Galaxy S24+ were discovered on Geekbench. The model is identified as `SM-S926B`, equipped with an `Exynos 2400` chipset, 8GB of RAM, and the Android 14 operating system. It achieved a single-core score of `2067` and a multi-core score of `6520`.  

These scores were lower than those of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is based on the Snapdragon 8 3rd generation chipset, indicating that the Exynos 2400 might have slightly lower performance in initial testing. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is expected to improve performance by 43% in single core and 36% in multi-core compared to the previous model, Galaxy S23 Ultra.
